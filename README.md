## Classification of Fire Types in India Using MODIS Satellite Data (2021–2023)

India witnesses various types of fire incidents annually, including forest fires, agricultural burning, volcanic activity, and other thermal anomalies. Accurate identification of fire sources is crucial for timely disaster response, environmental monitoring, and resource management. The MODIS sensors aboard NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites provide reliable, near real-time thermal anomaly data globally, including for India.

While the MODIS dataset includes rich geospatial and thermal parameters, the challenge lies in correctly classifying the type of fire event — whether it stems from vegetation, volcanoes, static land sources, or offshore sources — using satellite-captured features.

### Objective:
To develop a machine learning classification model that can accurately predict the type of fire using MODIS fire detection data for India from 2021 to 2023

### 🔥 MODIS Dataset Summary (India: 2021–2023)
#### 📌 About MODIS:
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is a key NASA sensor aboard the Terra (launched 1999) and Aqua (launched 2002) satellites. It captures Earth observation data at a spatial resolution of 1 km, suitable for global fire monitoring and environmental studies.

MODIS data used in this project is sourced from NASA’s FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System) and focuses on thermal anomalies and active fire detection.

## 🛰️ Satellite Characteristics:
Terra satellite (EOS AM) captures morning overpasses.

Aqua satellite (EOS PM) captures afternoon overpasses.

MODIS provides 2–4 observations per day, especially in mid-latitudes like India.

## 🔍 Fire Detection Mechanism:
*MODIS uses contextual algorithms to detect thermal anomalies.*

*It evaluates each pixel using mid-infrared channels (Bands 21/22 for  fire detection and 31 for surface temperature).*

*The pixel is marked as one of: missing, cloud, water, non-fire, fire, or unknown.*




### ⚠️ Note on Accuracy:
MODIS NRT (Near Real-Time) data may have slightly lower geolocation accuracy, particularly from Aqua satellite due to orbit estimation delays. Errors can occasionally reach several kilometers.



### ✅ Use Cases for MODIS Fire Data:
Real-time wildfire alerts

Agricultural burn detection

Forest fire management

Hotspot pattern analysis in ecological studies

- **IDE**: VS Code with Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

## 🚀 How to Run This Project Locally

Follow these steps to run the complete **Fire Classification** project — including data analysis and the Streamlit web app — on your local machine.

---

### 📁 Step 1: Download Project Files

📦 Clone or download the repository and ensure it includes:
- `Fire classification.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook for analysis and model training  
- `app.py` – Streamlit web app for fire type prediction  
- Dataset CSV files:  
  - `MODIS_fire_2021.csv`  
  - `MODIS_fire_2022.csv`  
  - `MODIS_fire_2023.csv`

🗂️ Place all files in a single project directory for easy access.

---

### ⚙️ Step 2: Install Dependencies

🧪 Make sure **Python 3.x** is installed. Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
💡 Alternatively, install manually:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn folium scikit-learn imbalanced-learn xgboost streamlit joblib

---

### 📊 Step 3: Run Jupyter Notebook (Model Training)

- 🧠 Open the notebook:
 ```copy
 jupyter notebook
```
- Launch Fire classification.ipynb

- Run all cells in order

- This loads, cleans, and analyzes data, then trains and saves the ML model (model.pkl or similar)

✅ Ensure no errors and the model file is saved successfully.

---

### 🌐 Step 4: Launch the Streamlit Web App

In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
🌍 This will automatically open the app in your browser. If not, open the local URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:8501).

---

### 🔍 Step 5: Use the Web App for Predictions

- 🖱️ In the Streamlit interface:

- Enter input values such as brightness, FRP, latitude, longitude, etc.

- Click on the Predict button

✅ Instantly view the predicted fire type on the screen!
